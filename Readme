Vila Valério May 31, 2010 - ES - Brazil 
	I'm not a programmer, I'm just an autodidact, and am studying shel script for less than a year. I decided to create the ZPacman. Because I did not enjoy any of the graphical interfaces that found for the pacman. 
	I'ma passionate about Linux, I used almost all the major distros, like slackware, debian and, finding the archlinux was the best thing for me gathered for what was best in debian and slackware. in my humble opinion of course! The ZPacman, is quite simple, if not the best and most complete I was out of sheer lack of capacity right! 
	Surely there must be bugs in it, he is free and under GPL, this is my first contribution to a community Linux. Critiques, suggestions and especially corrections are always welcome. Much of the codes are based on "PacGUI" created by "jorchube," Thanks for being "jorchube" PacGUI I found very interesting, I wanted something similar, but not dependent on the yaourt. It was done in Portuguese, for users in Brazil . but can be easily translated into any language. I hope it can be useful! Any questions, or suggestions, do not be shy, send email to "silveriomm@bol.com.br"

ZPacman-2010.06

	In this version were made to review, cleanliness, and organization of code, and were also removed some messages
that was not very accurate, so the program becomes more agile and does not emit false messages.
